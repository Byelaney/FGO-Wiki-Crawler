## FGO-Wiki-Crawler

I'm a fan of FGO(Fate Grand Order), instead of game I'm usually obsessed with the story behind each servant. This is a playtoy project to crawl FGO data from fgowiki.

### TODO List

- [x] servant's image
- [x] servant's noble phantasm video
- [x] equipment card image
- [x] equipment card detail
- [ ] resource detail
- [ ] servant's detail
- [ ] use multi-thread to speed up crawl
- [ ] crawl an input servant
- [ ] auto-find servant when user types his prefix
